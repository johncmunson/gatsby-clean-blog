### Gatsby Clean Blog

Example site built with this template: https://www.truthyfalsy.net/

If you are looking for a clean, elegant blog template that doesn't skimp on critical features then you've come to the right spot. Gatsby Clean Blog is built with Gatsby, the most advanced static site generator on the block. Gatsby itself is powered by React and Webpack. Think about it like a modern Jekyll.

> Gatsby.js is a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads only the critical HTML, CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the site feels incredibly fast. --Gatsby docs

Unlike other Gatsby starters, which are often meant to demonstrate one thing in isolation, Gatsby Clean Blog aims to be closer in spirit to the immensely popular [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) project. This means you can have a production ready blog with sane defaults up and running in minutes, but it isn't aimed at beginners. To hack on the source, you should already be very comfortable with React and have hopefully skimmed through the Gatsby documentation to understand the additional abstractions.
