For active outdoors enthusiasts, some days it feels like everything has already been done, nothing new remains, everything is meaningless and maybe you should just take up an indoor hobby instead. But wait! There is some good news: Caving (also alternatively known as spelunking in America and Canada, and potholing in Britain) has yet to be ruined by extreme sports bros and selfie-snapping tourists.

Better yet, there are an estimated 45,000 caves in the contiguous US alone (we're not even counting Alaska!), meaning there really is no limit to the amount of underground passageways available for you to explore if you don't have issues with the dark or with small, chest-constricting spaces -- which helpfully eliminates, like, more than half the population. Here we've picked out some of the coolest caves in the country to explore. Happy cave-diving, and don't watch The Descent before you head out there!

# Meramec Caverns

**_Sullivan, MO_** - With more than 6,400 recorded caves -- though only 20 are open to the public for guided tours -- Missouri is known as the "Cave State." Meramec Caverns is the largest and most well-known of the bunch, thanks to its location along historic Route 66 and its infamy as a former hideout for Jesse James and his gang. It was also a stop along the Underground Railroad. These days it's outfitted with with neon signs, multicolored mood lighting, and manmade props along the well-lit guided tours. Meramec's 150,000 annual visitors can expect to see an ancient limestone Wine Table (which they call "world's rarest cave structure") and a seven-story "mansion" built underground.

# Fantastic Caverns

**_Springfield, MO_** - Fantastic Caverns is the only cave in North America to offer a completely ride-through tour, which lasts about an hour in a Jeep-drawn tram. This is not to cater to the laziness of Americans who can’t handle a mile-long walk -- and you know this is a true statement about real life -- but to preserve the natural beauty of the cave's vulnerable features.

# Marvel Cave at Silver Dollar City

**_Branson, MO_** - If you're going to go cave exploring, you might as well make it part of a larger theme park experience. At Branson's Silver Dollar City, tours of the Marvel Cave are included with the price of admission and depart every 30 minutes. The hour-long tour will start by taking you 300 feet below the surface into the grand Cathedral Room, ultimately taking you down 500 feet below the surface in Missouri's deepest cave. Afterward hit the Outlaw Run, the former Guinness World Record holder for the steepest wooden roller coaster. Because it's fun!

# Lost Canyon Cave at Top of the Rock

**_Ridgedale, MO_** - OK, yes, this is a LOT from Missouri. But it's the CAVE STATE! Also, this is one you can drink in -- in fact, you are encouraged to do so. At the Top of the Rock Ozarks Heritage Preserve located on a spectacular bluff overlooking Table Rock Lake, you'll find a Jack Nicklaus-designed par-3 golf course, the Ancient Ozarks Natural History Museum (with one of the finest and most extensive collections of ancient Ozark artifacts found in any museum in the world), beautifully designed dining spaces featuring custom artwork and Native artifacts, and a wine cellar dug out of the rock that opens out onto a patio with an infinity pool that overlooks the lake that is one of the best perches to view a sunset possibly anywhere.

But right, caves! So on the Lost Canyon Cave and Nature Trail, you'll hop aboard an electric golf cart, drive across covered Amish bridges, past dramatic natural rock formations and stunning waterfalls, and through the Lost Canyon Cave, where you will have a drink at the "cave bar" nestled next to the cascading underground four-story waterfall. Read that last sentence again and tell me that doesn't sound appealing.

# Jewel Cave

**_Custer, SD_** - There is so much cool shit to see above ground in the Black Hills of South Dakota that you might not even think there is just as much cool shit to see beneath the surface. Well, surprise! Jewel Cave, designated a national monument in 1908, has more than 180 miles of mapped and surveyed passageways, making it the third longest in the world. You can take one of four different guided tours through it, from easy to strenuous, but unfortunately you can't go exploring on your own -- no self-guided cave touring is allowed here. Three of the four tours do not accept reservations and are available on a first-come basis (though you can purchase tickets earlier in the day for a later tour), while the more extreme Wild Caving Tour does accept reservations. This one lasts three-to-four hours and is marked "extremely strenuous" where you will chimney cave walls, scramble over cave breakdown, use a rope assist on a nearly vertical wall, and belly-crawl through tight passages in areas with names like the Roller Coaster and Brain Drain.

# Cosmic Cavern

**_Berryville, AK_** - Out of Missouri but still in the Ozarks, Cosmic Cavern is Arkansas's largest privately-owned show cave, located right between Eureka Springs, Arkansas and Branson, Missouri. The cave is the warmest in the Ozarks at an unwavering 64 degrees year-round -- so, nice and cool in the summer, and nice and warm in the winter -- and features two "bottomless" cave lakes so deep that the bottoms have yet to be found. One of them, South Lake, has had trout in it for nearly 50 years -- some are blind and most are colorless. The other, in the Silent Splendor section that also features a 9-foot soda straw (the longest in the Ozarks), is so pristine and untouched that many of the beautiful formations are transparent. Guided walking tours run one hour, 15 minutes.

# Wind Cave National Park

**_Hot Springs, SD_** - Wind Cave (so named for the whistling wind ever-present at its entrance) is considered one of the longest and most complex caves in the world. It is home to 95 percent of the world's entire collection of the delicate, web-like boxwork cave formations, which remain one of the cave's many mysteries. It was the world's first cave to be designated a national park in 1903, and visitors can explore it through ranger-led tours including two specialty tours: the Historic Candlelight Cave Tour and the more daring Wild Cave Tour. Reservations are accepted for both; all other tours of varying degrees of difficulty are first come, first served, and no self-guided exploring is permitted.

# Luray Caverns

**_Luray, VA_** - The largest, most popular caverns in Eastern America are the Luray Caverns in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, some 4 million centuries in the making. Half a million visitors each year come to see the dramatic underground rock formations with guided tours that take you through Giant’s Hall with its towering Double Column, Frozen Fountain, Dream Lake, Saracen’s Tent, Titania's Veil, and the Great Stalacpipe Organ -- the largest instrument in the world which uses electronically-controlled rubber mallets to gently tap the cave's stalactites, turning 3 acres of the cave into a music hall.

# Mammoth Cave

**_Mammoth National Park, KY_** - This UNESCO World Heritage Site is the longest cave system in the world with 400 miles of explored caves.​ Free self-guided tours, as well as not-free guided tours, are available all year, ranging from the kid-friendly (read: easy) to the moderately strenuous but incredibly scenic to the strenuous and challenging. There are a LOT of different options for guided tours, but if you're looking for some excitement, the six-hour Wild Cave Tour is for you, winding through 5 miles of "wild" cave passages that require climbing, crawling, and squeezing to get through. Because of white nose syndrome, a disease caused by an invasive fungus that is destroying the North American cave-dwelling bat population, cavers are not permitted to use their own equipment but for boots; all other equipment and outwear (including gloves) is provided by the park.

# Carlsbad Caverns

**_Carlsbad Caverns National Park, NM_** - In the dead heat of summer you might not otherwise want to spend too much time in the Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico, but things get a little cooler beneath the surface as you explore the 119+ caves of this national park. Sulfuric acid dissolving the surrounding limestone formed these caves over millions of years, and you can explore them on one of two different self-guided tours, or join a ranger-led tour for an additional fee. The Big Room is the most popular, drawing in some 300,000 visitors per year to explore its 357,480 square feet. Other areas, like the Hall of the White Giant and the Spider Cave, require crawling. And if you're visiting May through October, stick around for the Bat Flight Program, when hundreds of thousands of Brazilian free-tailed bats exit the cave at dusk to forage for food.
